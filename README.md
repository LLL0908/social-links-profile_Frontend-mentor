I learned how to control the size and shape of image by using the background.

```css
.profile-photo {
    width: 6em;
    height: 6em;
    margin: 0 auto;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-image: url("cute.jpg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top;
    background-size: cover;
}
```

### Continued development
keep learning
